1. note for example, in the case 1 1 3, it can not trap any water actually. So height_difference = 0 is reasonable.

2. Core point: height_difference * width, so we traverse using enumerate

3. pop() is bottom_height; left is -1; right is v.

4. height_diff = min(left_height, right_height) - bottom_height

5. width = i - stack[-1] - 1

6. note if not stack: break. This is because, later, we need to find stack[-1] as left height, and there is no water with for example 1, 2,b ecause left is empty
and can not trap water.
